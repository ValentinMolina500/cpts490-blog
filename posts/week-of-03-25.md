Springbreak is over, so I'm back in school. The progress stepper component got the A-OK so I'm moving on to the next component. That component is a network view of computers and servers. It's a good thing I took Graph Theory last semester. I'm researching using d3.js for the visualization since I've seen it used for network graphs with great success.

I also called a pull request for that table component on Risk Analysis so I'm waiting for feedback on it.
