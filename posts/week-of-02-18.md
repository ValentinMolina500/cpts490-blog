This week was much a return to normalcy. I split my work between two main tasks.

The first task was to port a login component that will be shared between multiple applications to Svelte. Let me talk about Svelte: it's yet another front-end framework... was my initial reaction. Our lead supervisor, Mr. Tycko Franklin, suggested we use Svelte to develop one a new application. Svelte is a deligh to develop with! It's rather new but the framework's main goal of reducing boilerplate code and quality of life features for developing front-end applications is great. I digress, but that's what I worked on. I talked with the UI/UX team to get some new advice on the login client.

The second task I worked on was working on a progress stepper component for SCTR. Basically, we have these things called testbeds which can be in different states:
- Inactive
- Building
- Active
- Destroying

Each state needs a different view associated with it. The progress stepper component will be used in the Building/Destroying views to show the progress and different steps of those states. It wasn't too crazy but I wanted to get it done before Friday since I requested that day off for Crimson Code!
