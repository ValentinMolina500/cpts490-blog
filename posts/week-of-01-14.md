This week I worked on bug fixes for a date picker component used in one of the application we are developing. Date pickers are complex, and the more my fellow developers and other users interact with the date picker, the more bugs we seem to log. 

I also spent some time updating the CDK for this application. The CDK allows us to specify Amazon Web Services cloud resources in code. It's very neat technology!
