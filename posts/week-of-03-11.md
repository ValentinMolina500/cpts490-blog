I mostly worked on the table component this week while my code was being reviewed for SCTR. Getting the styling of the component correct and column logic was imperative. Since I did not have some stub data to work with, I tried to make the API of the table abstract enough to work with any data configuration with dynamic column properties and custom render functions for certain columns to provide flexibilty for how table cells display their content.
