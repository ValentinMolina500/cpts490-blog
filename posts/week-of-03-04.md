This week I finished implementing the login page described last week and shifted to implementing a table for that new module I mentioned. I researched best practices with HTML tables and found some cool functionality that I hadn't known before, that being `colgroup` to apply styles to whole columns! The table had some more custom functionality, such as dropdowns and special filters so I'm still working on implementing that. 

I also spent more time reviewing my peers code. Reviewing code is something I can get better at. Often time I just glance at the code and it looks good so I give it the A-ok. But now I will pull down the code and actually run it on my machine to get a better idea of how it's working.
