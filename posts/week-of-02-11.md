Finally.

I finished my task on the list view for the File Share component of EGRASS. It's funny, the task was simply to add an expand folder feature to folders in the list view, but it turned into a major refactoring of the very way we store files and folders. Of course, I also had to update other components (and there were plenty) that relied on the old way of storing files and folders.

This included the following components:
- The grid view of files and folders
- the create folder form
- the file/folder notes component
- the move file form
and a lot more.

Thankfully, I only needed to change a bit of the logic to acccomdate for my changes. The biggest component to update there was the move file component. However, it felt great to finish this task even though it took longer than I wanted it to. The other developers thanked me for my "stellar work" on the list view, that felt great ðŸ˜ƒ.

The project manager for EGRASS was really pushing for this functionality due to the stakeholders saying it would be a great view option, so it's great we could add to the site. Next week, I can focus on other projects/components now.
