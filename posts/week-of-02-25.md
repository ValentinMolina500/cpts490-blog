This week was all hands on deck on a new module in an exisitng web application. It's common as an intern at PNNL to be told "stop what you're doing, we need you to work on this!". I was tasked with implementing an abstract login page that would be used across various of our applications using Svelte (yay!). That amounts to implementing the reset password flow as well. It's just a lot for forms and exception handling for when the user forgets or misinputs their credentials. Also, simple form validation to make sure the user enters all the required data. Nothing to groundbreaking here, but the sponsor wants authentication so here we go.
