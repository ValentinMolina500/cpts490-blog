This week I continued to work on the previous mention task of opening one application inside of another. Building on previous work, I was able to use a flag to detect if the application is opened within another application and thus make changes to the UI conditionally on that. I'm trying to add as little code as possible, so I'm favoring reusing existing components/logic for data fetching and visualization. Most of time this week has been working on this UI and also reviewing code from peers.
